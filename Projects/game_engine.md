# C++ Game Engine

This is a personal openGL rendering and eventually game engine project used to learn openGL. This engine has been built from the ground up, loosely on opengl and game engine tutorials, as well as some personal research.

This project has largely been abandonned. I may pick it up again.

### Goals
* Fill in my coding gaps
* Learn OpenGL
* Make a game
