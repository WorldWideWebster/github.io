## Hardware Prototyping

### Assembling the circuit
Now that the initial design is out of the way, I can finally start assembling the circuit (This may have been completed before the start of the writeup). There are a few ways to adapt the ESP01 to work with a breadboard, and I chose an [adapter board](https://www.amazon.com/Stemedu-Breakout-Breadboard-Pre-Solder-Transceiver/dp/B07KBZRZ3Y), but not this specific one, from amazon.
