# IoT Temperature Probe

I am in the process of designing an IoT temperature probe, with a waterproof probe.
The ideal use case is to put a probe in my compost, aquariums, and beehives. This project is as much about learning as it is about teaching. 
I plan to document each step meticulously, hoping to fill any gaps in my understanding and provide a comprehensive guide for others interested in similar IoT ventures.

This project consists of an [ESP-01](https://www.microchip.ua/wireless/esp01.pdf), a [DS18B20](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf),
 and a [LM3671](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm3671.pdf) with 5V USB input.
