# Intro
My significant other is not as OCD as me in using every last bit of conditioner out of the containers.

I designed a F-F bottle adapter for Aussie brand bottles

I designed it to hold a gasket in the middle to seal between the bottles. This is still a WIP, as the threads rip, or the print splits.
I tried changing the layer angle to account for the splitting, but that did not work. I'm thinking maybe a fastener next time.
