# Intro
I had a lot of foam board that I wanted semi accurately cut, without some fumes, and without dulling a ton of razors.
I designed this to clamp onto any Dewalt jigsaw, and to make the profile able to be clamped by a Kreg generic tracksaw.

Though the design was a success, the foam blade deflected too much. I ended up doing about 1/4 of my garage insulation panels with this, and the rest with a hot knife.
