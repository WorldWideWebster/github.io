Happy New Year!

# Project Update: IoT Temp Probe
Great progress has been made on the IoT Temp Probe project. The design and prototyping phases are now complete. 
To keep the blog dynamic and engaging, I'll delve into the details of the prototyping in my next post. 
Meanwhile, you can explore the project's evolution [here](/Projects/iot_temp_probe/prototyping.md).

# New Years Reflections
## In General
2023 was a year of contrasting experiences for me. It brought joy through my first international travel, satisfaction 
from my job, and the fulfillment of personal projects like planting a micro orchard and expanding my apiary.

However, it wasn't without its challenges. Battling Covid, enduring the loss of my grandparents, and facing a job layoff
 were tough hurdles. Nonetheless, these experiences have strengthened me, and I look forward to a brighter year ahead.

## On Blogging
This post marks a month of consistent blogging â€“ a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. While I relish the process of 
creating projects, documenting them is a different ballgame. However, it's a skill I'm keen on honing. So, here's to more 
sharing and learning through this platform!

## Goals For the New Year
My goal is to complete the IoT Temp Probe project and embark on more intriguing and personally beneficial ventures. Over 
the years, many ideas have brewed in my mind. It's time to bring them to life, committing to at least one significant 
personal engineering project annually.

## Notable Books and Shows This Year I've Consumed
* **[Scavengers Reign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavengers_Reign)** - An adult animated sci-fi series that brilliantly tackles complex themes.
* **[MurderBot Series](https://www.amazon.com/The-Murderbot-Diaries-7-book-series/dp/B07FK8SNWY)** - A captivating narrative about a cyborg who wants to be left alone so they can watch StarGate-esque shows.
* **[Michael J Sullivan's Riyria Series](https://riyria.blogspot.com/)** - Intriguing fantasy series set in a well-crafted universe.

# What I'm reading and listening to
## Test Driven Development for Embedded C
I've picked up [Test Driven Development for Embedded C](https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Embedded-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435662X/) 
to better improve my understanding and implementation of unit tests.
I've seen other engineers are previous jobs with this book, and I've had it recommended to me,
so I figured it was time to pick it up.

### Thoughts on Chapters 1-2
These chapters introduce the ideas of unit tests, and quick introductory implementations using [Unity](https://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) and [CPPUTest](https://cpputest.github.io/). Everything is presented very straight forward, and can
easily be implemented. I've worked with Unity before, I think.

## Podcasts
I've been regularly tuning into [The Embedded Podcast](embedded.fm) and [The Amp Hour](https://theamphour.com/). Both are
 excellent sources of information and insights in the tech world.
