I've made numerous updates to the blog. It's almost in a place where I can finally leave it and start doing the projects I want to share on the blog. I've moved to bi-weekly blog posts (as opposed to weekly updates), in an effort to keep updates regular, but to also give time to improve quality. For the time being I want to commit to these semi-weekly blog posts, even if they're not of much substance, themselves. However, some of the pages and changes I've made are more work than a blog post. I would also like to move to a point where the blog is not the main focus of my time, as it seems to have eaten most of my project time.

I'm still in the mode of throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, and to find the voice and audience of this blog. Right now, it's still just
a personal projects blog, with some (hopefully helpful) info sprinkled about. I plan to narrow the focus to electronics, but also keep my hobbies on the peripheral.

## Blog Updates
A recent blog update had caused it to greatly slow down. I've tried batch editing my photos to make them much smaller, and it seams to have worked.
Thanks to [BIMP](https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/), a plugin for GIMP. It turns out I did not need to upload print quality photos to my blog.

I've added my [guitars projects](/Projects/Guitars), and specifically my work on my [Aria Pro II Knight Warrior](/Projects/Guitars/AriaProII_Knight_Warrior) that I recently completed,
and [My First Partscaster](/Projects/Guitars/first_custom_partscaster.md) that I did before then.

I've added the [ViewSTL Plugin](https://www.viewstl.com/plugin/), with a lot of help from [Slim Nate](https://slimnate.com/blogging/tutorial/2021/04/18/displaying-3d-models.html).
This allowed me to display my 3d models that I've created, [here](/Projects/3D_Printing/)

I've added the [Tutorials Section](/Tutorials/) and have condensed my previous tutorials and put them there.

I still have a bunch of completed and in progress projects that I plan to add to the projects pages.

## A little retrospective
I've been looking at the [ESP8266 RTOS SDK](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK/tree/master), and honestly, I have no idea why I made the post "Inspecting esp-open-sdk and esp-open-rtos". 
I think I may have had misconceptions of licensing for the idea I was thinking of productizing. Having worked professionally with the ESP32 IDF, that concern was a moot point. 
I now plan to work with the official SDK, which uses FreeRTOS, which removes a lot of the hassle of setup, due to the amount of people testing and contributing to it.

## What's on the workbench
Here's a peak to what I'm physically working on. I'm finding guitar maintenance and building to be a zen-like activity. I can throw on a podcast or audiobook, and just get to work.

I picked up this bass as a thank you gift for a friend. This one was made in Korea, at the same factories that Fender had contracted to make their instruments in the 80's and 90's, post CBS acquisition. 
I plan to give it a good cleanup and send it on its way. Forgive the state of my workbench, I'm still trying to figure out a happy medium for it.

## Some interesting papers I've come across this week:
From a discussion of acoustic guitar bracing in a luthier facebook group:
[Frequency Response Evaluation of Guitar Bodies with Different Bracing Systems](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/5/795)

From a discussion with friends about automating knitting:
[A compiler for 3D machine knitting](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/134995)

From a google search after a question about the curious death of some of my bees: 
[A New Threat to Honey Bees, the Parasitic Phorid Fly Apocephalus borealis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250467/)
