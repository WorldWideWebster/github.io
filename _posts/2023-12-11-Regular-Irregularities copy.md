## Blog Updates
I've been updating the blog a ton, to avoid actually doing the coding projects I want to do. I swear I want to do them.

The blog update has caused it to greatly slow down. I've tried batch editing my photos to make them much smaller, and it seams to have worked.
Thanks to [BIMP](https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/), a plugin for GIMP

I've added my [guitars projects](/Projects/Guitars), and specifically my work on my [Aria Pro II Knight Warrior](/Projects/Guitars/AriaProII_Knight_Warrior) that I completed this week.

I've added the [ViewSTL Plugin](https://www.viewstl.com/plugin/), with a lot of help from [Slim Nate](https://slimnate.com/blogging/tutorial/2021/04/18/displaying-3d-models.html).
This allowed me to display my 3d models that I've created, [here](/Projects/3D_Printing/)

I still have a bunch of projects that I plan to add to the projects pages. A guitar I've built, and a bunch of 3D prints.

For the time being I want to commit to weekly blog posts, even if they're not of much substance, themselves. However, some of the pages and changes I've made are more work than a blog post.

## A little retrospective
I've been looking at the [ESP8266 RTOS SDK](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK/tree/master), and honestly, I have no idea why I made post 2022-09-09. I think I may have been scared of
licensing for the idea I was thinking of productizing. But after having worked professionally with the ESP32 IDF, that concern was a moot point.

## What's on the workbench

I picked up this bass as a thank you gift for a friend. This one was made in Korea, at the same factories that Fender had contracted to make their instruments in the 80's and 90's, post CBS acquisition. 
I plan to give it a good cleanup and send it on its way. Forgive the state of my workbench, I'm still trying to figure out a happy medium for it.

## Some interesting papers I've come across this week:
From a discussion of acoustic guitar bracing in a luthier facebook group:
[Frequency Response Evaluation of Guitar Bodies with Different Bracing Systems](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/5/795)

From a discussion with friends about automating knitting:
[A compiler for 3D machine knitting](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/134995)

From a google search after a question about the curious death of some of my bees: 
[A New Threat to Honey Bees, the Parasitic Phorid Fly Apocephalus borealis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250467/)
