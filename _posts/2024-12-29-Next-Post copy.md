Happy New Year! What a weird year. 

# Project Update: IoT Temp Probe
I've made massive inroads with my temp probe project. The Design and prototyping phases are done.

# New Years Reflections
2023 had many good points, for me. It was my first year to travel internationally. I liked my job. I planted a micro orchard, build some garden boxes, did a bunch of house projects, and added another hive box to my apiary.

It also had many bad points. My first year to get Covid, my maternal grandparents died, and it was also my first year to be laid off.

Here's to the next year, hopefully it's a bit better.

# What I'm reading and listening to
## Test Driven Development for Embedded C
I've picked up [Test Driven Development for Embedded C](https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Embedded-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435662X/) 
to better improve my understanding and implementation of unit tests.
I've seen other engineers are previous jobs with this book, and I've had it recommended to me,
so I figured it was time to pick it up.

### Thoughts on Chapters 1-2
These chapters introduce the ideas of unit tests, and quick introductory implementations using [CPPUTest](https://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) and [Unity](https://cpputest.github.io/). Everything is presented very straight forward, and can
easily be implemented. I've worked with Unity before, I think.
