# An Update
I've started to work on my Wifi thermometer project again. So far, I plan to use it in my compost outdoors, maybe in my indoor compost, and possibly in my beehives. It's a simple project, a test for if I can write a decent tutorial, and a good stepping stone to kick off my dev blog. I may play around with other projects during its development, but have numerous ideas for projects after.

## Blog Updates
The blog update has caused it to greatly slow down. I've tried batch editing my photos to make them much smaller
