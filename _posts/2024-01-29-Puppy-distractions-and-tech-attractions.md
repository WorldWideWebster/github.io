<sup>Picture: My new puppy, Fuji. 8 weeks old. Jan 2024 </sup>

Since my last update, life has taken an exciting turn with the arrival of a 9-week-old Australian Shepherd puppy, named Fuji. As adorable as it is, puppy parenting has been quite the adventure, complete with sleepless nights. This has left me with limited chances and, admittedly, fewer coherent moments to dedicate to personal projects.

# Rabbit Holes
In the snippets of time when the puppy is asleep, I've managed to stumble upon some intriguing tech topics:

1. [CoAP - Constrained Application Protocol](https://coap.space/): Delving into this web transfer protocol has been fascinating. It's designed for constrained devices and networks, making it an ideal study for IoT enthusiasts.

2. [Never Work in Theory](https://neverworkintheory.org/): This site offers a unique perspective on software engineering research, challenging conventional wisdom and sparking new thoughts.
