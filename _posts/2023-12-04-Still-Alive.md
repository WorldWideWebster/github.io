# An Update
I've started to work on my blog, as well as my Wifi thermometer project, again. So far, I plan to use it in my compost outdoors, maybe in my indoor compost, and possibly in my beehives. It's a simple project, a test for if I can write a decent tutorial, and a good stepping stone to kick off my dev blog. I may play around with other projects during its development, but have numerous ideas for projects after.

## Blog Updates
I have completely changed my blog layout, chosen a new theme and modified it. I chose [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), but it was missing post functionality. I shamelessly pulled in some elements from my previous theme, Millennial. I have added the ability to show blog posts in the sidebar. I also added watermarks to my photos. Some of the new elements work, and some of the old elements no longer work - it's still a work in progress. I don't like the blog to take up most of my project time, but it has.

I've chosen to include a projects directory, too. I've added my abandoned [game engine](/docs/Projects/game_engine.md), the [wifi thermometer](/docs/Projects/wifi_thermometer.md), and the [blog](/docs/Projects/blog.md). I may find a way to categorize my blog posts with tags to create a tutorial directory. I'm also looking for a way to embedded parts of blog posts into pages.
