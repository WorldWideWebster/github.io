# A Masterclass in Yak Shaving


**According to google,** 

Yak shaving is programming lingo for the seemingly endless series of small tasks that have to be completed before the next step in a project can move forward


I first heard the term years ago, and I can't remember the source. Here's another [great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0&ab_channel=VincentVerschuren)

Interestingly (to me) enough, the source of the original phrase stems from Ren and Stimpy's [Shaven Yak of Yaksmas Eve](http://www.deadpark.com/wp-content/uploads/Yak-Shaving-Day.mp4?_=1) 

You get the idea.

So, yes, I'd like to make an embedded project, and to document it along the way, so I had to make a blog. 
I decided I didn't quite like blogger so I checked out github pages.
I've never touched ruby before, so that's pretty neat. So here we are, on github pages.

Having only made one page on blogger, rather than fuss with tools to migrate to ghpages, I chose to copy and reformat.
Migration [seems to exist](https://dylanbeattie.net/2019/08/14/migrating-from-blogger-to-github-pages.html) and looks
to be relatively simple [in some cases](http://www.philjhale.com/2021-08-02-migrating-from-blogger-to-github-pages/#:~:text=First%2C%20export%20all%20the%20posts,XML%20file%20at%20the%20root.)

As for general blog things, these things usually have pictures, right? Well, I'm fuzzy on copyright usage, etc. 
While I look into that, here's a picture of a North American Carpenter Bee on a pumpkin flower that I took
