## Blog Updates
I've been updating the blog a ton, to avoid actually doing the coding projects I want to do. I swear I want to do them.

The blog update has caused it to greatly slow down. I've tried batch editing my photos to make them much smaller, and it seams to have worked.
Thanks to [BIMP](https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/), a plugin for GIMP

I've added my [guitars projects](/Projects/Guitars), and specifically my work on my [Aria Pro II Knight Warrior](/Projects/Guitars/AriaProII_Knight_Warrior)

I've added the [ViewSTL Plugin](https://www.viewstl.com/plugin/), with a lot of help from [Slim Nate](https://slimnate.com/blogging/tutorial/2021/04/18/displaying-3d-models.html).
This allowed me to display my 3d models that I've created, [here](/Projects/3D_Printing/)

I still have a bunch of projects that I plan to add to the projects pages. A guitar I've built, and a bunch of 3D prints.

For the time being I want to commit to weekly blog posts, even if they're not of much substance, themselves. However, some of the pages and changes I've made are more work than a blog post.
