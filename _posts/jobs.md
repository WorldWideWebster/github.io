Ok, technically since Friday the 13th of October, but I couldn't think of a title that incorporated it.

Post frequency of this blog is a function inversely correlated to job satisfaction and, now that I am currently unemployed, frequency is undefined.

# Thoughts on the current state of the job market
I've mainly used LinkedIn to find jobs (3/5), with all of those having been me searching and then applying to relevant roles. In this job search cycle, LinkedIn's search has become near useless. But, it's not just LinkedIn, either. Indeed/Glassdoor, Monster, etc have all killed this useful feature.  Searching 'firmware' or 'embedded' gets results that have nothing to do with either of those. They don't even contain those key words! This seems to largely be following the trend of the [Enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) of the internet. Google and Bing job searches are better, maybe because they are aggregating multiple sites. I think all of this has to do with late market monetization schemes. LinkedIn is now a mature product, and was recently acquired by Microsoft. I imagine they didn't make enough money to be profitable, and now the higher ups are looking for ways to make value. Somehow ruining the search does that.

Google's job search is what I remember Indeed and LinkedIn having been

## LinkedIn Premium: People Pay for This?
I recently signed up for a free trial of LinkedIn Premium. It seems that with the premium versions of these websites (or at least LinkedIn), [what should be by default] a semi usable search bar is unlocked. I say 'semi usable' because in searching 'firmware' or 'embedded', more than half of the results do not include the key word. I'm curious if this hurts companies, who have applicants who never see their postings. However, this is one site out of may - perhaps the others have no path to a usable search functionality.
It's mind boggling how they could have ruined searching this much. I wish I had a screencap from before I had premium.

In the race to the bottom with big tech, it seems some of the newer contenders are still offering features the giants used to offer.

## New Players
A promising alternative I've found is [Climate Tech List](https://www.climatetechlist.com/). It is a refreshing alternative, which displays postings in a spreadsheet fashion. It has the upside of having its companies directly focused on tackling climate change in some way or form. The downside is the amount of companies focused on that.

Another is [Zip Recruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/). Key words and locations in their search actually work (that's a low bar, I know). I haven't dug into the features of this site, but it seems promising.

And, yes, I know recruiters exist. And I have talked to many in every job search I've done. But, good recruiters are rare. They also have plenty of other people and job titles to focus on, and can't dedicate nearly as much time as I can to finding me a job.

There at least have been some improvements in technology that help with job hunting. With the popularization of Large Language Models like ChatGPT, generating the bones of a cover letter takes seconds. By inputting the job description and a resume, a tailor-made (though written as a freshmen college essay) cover letter is generated. As with all AI generated content, some tweaking, or out right rewriting, is needed. While this may be a moral gray area, cover letter examples online seem to be largely similar, following a well defined format. It's nearly a perfect example of a suitable application of a LLM. Cover letters may become a thing of the past, due to the new tools available. This sort of change, however, takes time.

### On that Note
I've been told that the end of the year is the slowest time to find a job. This is apparently due to the timing of budgets, vacation, and holidays all causing the perfect storm of being unable to hire. The vacations and holidays make it nearly impossible to get an interview board together, and budgets usually renew in January.

On top of that, this is definitely a bad year, especially for the tech sector. And remote jobs. I've seen some jobs fill their applicant pool in a day - it's crazy.

## Blog Updates
This is my personal dev blog, not a job hunting blog.

I plan to continue my wifi thermometer project - and use it in my compost outdoors, maybe in my indoor compost, and possibly in my beehives. It's a simple project, a test for if I can write a decent tutorial, and a good stepping stone to kick off my dev blog. I may play around with other projects during its development, but have numerous ideas for projects after.

I have completely changed my blog layout, chosen a new theme and modified it. I chose [Just the docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), but it was missing post functionality. I shamelessly pulled in some elements from my previous theme, Millennial. I've also added watermarks to my photos. Some of the new elements work, and some of the old elements no longer work

I've chosen to include a projects directory, too. I've added my abandoned [game engine](/docs/Projects/game_engine.md), the [wifi thermometer](/docs/Projects/wifi_thermometer.md), and the [blog](/docs/Projects/blog.md). I may find a way to categorize my blog posts with tags to create a tutorial directory. I'm also looking for a way to embedded parts of blog posts into pages.
