# MTA UltimateUM for Mites, Thrips, Aphids
This is a recipe I found in a fig growing facebook group that links to a pot grower forum. There, 'JohnnyPotseed' and an 'anonymous friend' divulged this recipe
I've made one batch, so far. The results were very impressive. It's made with food safe ingredients (literally all food ingredients).
I dispersed with a Ryobi (blegh) handheld fogger. No damage to plants was seen.
Would recommend a half batch or smaller. I made a half gallon of solution (not concentrate), and ended up not using it all.
