About a decade ago from writing this (2023), I picked up my first real guitar since moving to MA.
I had an Aria acoustic, which was the guitar I learned on, so I knew the name Aria.
Aria Pro OO was their 80's attempt at modern rebranding.

\$60 later, I had an Aria Pro II Knight Warrior, which was in playable, yet rough shape.

At some point and time, probably around 2014, the pickguard around the jack broke. The guitar then went into cold storage.

You can see it in this photo

I had attempted to make a new pickguard out of a sheet of polycarbonate with a dremel, but the quality just wasn't what I wanted.

About 8 years later, I decided to try to find a new pickguard. I found [PickguardPlanet](pickguardplanet.com), who were very helpful (at first).
I accidentally ordered the wrong pickguard, but was ghosted by them, trying to get the right one. Apparently there were 2 shapes,
one to fix the breaking by the jack, that all of these models had.

Back in storage the guitar went.

Until my friend had purchased a 4'x4' CNC router table. And she offered to let me use it? Score.
I have some experience with GIMP, so I scoured the internet for pictures of Knight Warriors, 
and scaled them with pictures of my pickguards, and made a vector file to cut a new one.

I used a hand full of pictures, and scaled/skewed them all. This is probably the most layers I've worked with.

I then used a cricut to check the fit, and once that was adjusted, threw it on the router. It only took 2 sheets of plastic to get right.

After a successful cut, I threw on the drill press to chamfer the mounting screw holes. Then it was time to finally mount it.

Noticing the guitar could use a good cleanup and setup, I disassembled everything. I filled some of the dents, and buffed the paint to a shine. 
I added a few layers of homemade shielding paint. I leveled, crowned, and buffed the frets. I oiled the fretboard. Then reassembled it all.

It plays like a dream. This thing is probably equivalent in build quality to MIA Fenders.

With an ad this racey, how could the guitar not be good? It was so easy to find years earlier, so might as well be a new place to host it.
