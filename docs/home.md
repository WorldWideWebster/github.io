# Please forgive the aesthetic.

Hello,

I’m Sean Webster. I’m an embedded software engineer with too many hobbies, and this is my blog. It is currently under construction (and may permanently stay that way). I’ve started it as a way to document my projects in one place, as well as to showcase my skills. I also want to help people who run into the same problems I do, and want to learn how to do the things I do.

This is my place to get stuck in the weeds and live there.

I like taking photos, and have currently decided to use them for blog cover photos.
