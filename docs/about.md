Hello,

I'm Sean Webster. I'm an embedded software engineer. I've been one since 2017, when I graduated from UMASS Lowell.
Though, I've been 'programming' since 2007, where I pursued learning C++ to try to make my own video games in high school (you can guess how that went).

In my free time, I acquire hobbies. So far, I'm a maker, musician, photographer, beekeeper, gardener, horticulturist, 
fishkeeper, machinist, handyman, homeowner, motorcyclist, 3d modeler, naturalist... etc. you get the picture. 

## I've done work in:
- Semiconductor on 2 separate occasions, where I 
  - was an intern writing test software and plans for power distributers for linear accelerators of ion implanters for wafers
  - was fresh out of college, fixing bugs in lithography reticle handler firmware tests
- Medical Devices on a few occasions, where I
  - Developed a proof of concept pill tracking IoT button back end server
  - Created a proof of concept 2 way telepresence for surgical robotics, with 4 channel video and camera control
  - Worked on bug fixes for a surgical robot
- Consumer robotics, where I was on the autonomous lawnmower project doing everything from hardware/software factory support to complex reactive behaviours and environment characterization.
- Automotive, where I worked with automotive grade Linux and flutter.

I've created projects from scratch, and I've worked on projects with billions of lines of code.

This is my blog. It is currently under construction (and may permanently stay that way). I've started it as a way to document my projects in one place, as well as to showcase my skills. 
I also want to help people who run into the same problems I do, and want to learn how to do the things I do. Regardless, there is something cathartic about launching your ideas into the void.
