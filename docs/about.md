Hello,

I'm Sean Webster. I'm an embedded software engineer. I've been one since 2017, though I've been 'programming' 
since 2007. I'm a maker, photographer, beekeeper, gardener, horticulturist, fishkeeper, machinist, handyman, homeowner,
motorcyclist, 3d modeler, naturalist... etc. you get the picture. 

I've done work in the semiconductor, medical, consumer robotics, and automotive industries. I've worked on 2 man teams, and 
I've worked on 100 man teams. I've created projects from scratch, and I've worked on projects with billions of lines of code.

This is my blog. It is currently under construction (and may permanently stay that way). I've started it as a way to document my projects in one place, as well as to showcase my skills. 
I also want to help people who run into the same problems I do, and want to learn how to do the things I do.
