Hello,

I'm Sean Webster. I'm an embedded software engineer. I've been one since 2017, though I've been 'programming' 
since 2007. I'm a maker, photographer, beekeeper, gardener, horticulturist, fishkeeper, machinist, handyman, homeowner,
motorcyclist, 3d modeler, naturalist... etc. you get the picture. 

This is my blog. I've started it as a way to document my projects in one place, as well as to showcase my skills. 
I also want to help people who run into the same problems I do, and want to learn how to do the things I do.

### This blog uses:
* Millennial theme, a free jekyll theme thanks to [Paul Le](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/).
