Did I do it right?</p>

<p>This is a blog intended for me to write my thoughts, plans, etc down in the hopes that it will help not just me, but others as well.</p>

<p>I don’t pretend to be right all of the time, and I’m not right nearly as often as I pretend. Hopefully <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law">Cunningham’s Law</a> will make us all more enriched.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that I will look back on this first post with the maximum amount of regrets, so, here’s to you, future me. I hope it was worth it?</p>

<h2 id="planned-project-wifi-thermometer">Planned Project: Wifi Thermometer</h2>
<p>I have many stillborn projects in various states of development, and everything seems to be a variation on a wifi thermometer. I’ve made them for school, and I’ve made them for work, but I’d like to make one for myself. Simple enough, right?</p>

<p>The plan is to use up the hardware I’ve got on hand, which boils down to a grab bag of mid 2010’s dev boards and sensors.</p>

<p>For the micro, I’ll be using an <a href="https://www.microchip.ua/wireless/esp01.pdf">ESP-01</a> and for the temp sensor, a <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf">DS18B20</a>
I plan to prototype with arduino, but write my own code with some open source libraries for things like Wifi and One-wire (I don’t plan on ever using one-wire again after I exhaust these temp sensors(famous last words, I know)).</p>

<p>Well, let’s see how this ends up. Thanks for reading this far. Don’t forget to smash that like button, I guess?</p>
