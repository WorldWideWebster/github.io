<p><strong>According to google,</strong></p>

<p>Yak shaving is programming lingo for the seemingly endless series of small tasks that have to be completed before the next step in a project can move forward</p>

<p>I first heard the term years ago, and I can’t remember the source. Here’s another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0&amp;ab_channel=VincentVerschuren">great example</a></p>

<p>Interestingly (to me) enough, the source of the original phrase stems from Ren and Stimpy’s <a href="http://www.deadpark.com/wp-content/uploads/Yak-Shaving-Day.mp4?_=1">Shaven Yak of Yaksmas Eve</a></p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<p>So, yes, I’d like to make an embedded project, and to document it along the way, so I had to make a blog. 
I decided I didn’t quite like blogger so I checked out github pages.
I’ve never touched ruby before, so that’s pretty neat. So here we are, on github pages.</p>

<p>Having only made one page on blogger, rather than fuss with tools to migrate to ghpages, I chose to copy and reformat.
Migration <a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/2019/08/14/migrating-from-blogger-to-github-pages.html">seems to exist</a> and looks
to be relatively simple <a href="http://www.philjhale.com/2021-08-02-migrating-from-blogger-to-github-pages/#:~:text=First%2C%20export%20all%20the%20posts,XML%20file%20at%20the%20root.">in some cases</a></p>

<p>As for general blog things, these things usually have pictures, right? Well, I’m fuzzy on copyright usage, etc. 
While I look into that, here’s a picture of a North American Carpenter Bee on a pumpkin flower that I took</p>
